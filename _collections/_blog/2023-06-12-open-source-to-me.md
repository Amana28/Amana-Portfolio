Open Source (Open-Source Software) is software that is freely available to and accessible to the public. It is usually licensed under licensing methods which are lenient towards individuals like me who want to view, modify, and contribute to projects big and small! This opens a world of exciting projects for me to explore as well as a valuable community I can be a part of and learn from to help me become a better software developer. By engaging with Open-Source projects aligned with my passions, I aspire to enhance my problem-solving and innovation skills, fostering personal growth while making valuable contributions.
